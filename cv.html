            <h2>CV</h2><hr>
            <p>I received my education in Warsaw, Poland, I attended and graduated both Primary school and Technical college. 
                After only one semester of University, I dropped out, and completed my National service in the Polish Army. 
                Now, 23 years later, I want to make amends for my youth. To do so I have started a Computer Science BSc (Hons) Degree.
                Prior to re-joining University, I was a full time HGV driver and knew very little around web development, or even computing in general. I was the man who would take a hammer to a PC rather than find out what the problem was. This changed massively. 
                It started as a hobby, and in 2018 I began to think of a possible career change. I studied hard in my spare time and dabbled in Web Development and Python. Due to lack of time alongside my day job I knew I wouldnâ€™t be able to go any further unless I changed my plan. 
                So, I have put all my eggs in one basket, and here I am, making my own website for the Web development project.
