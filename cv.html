            <h2>Cv</h2>
            <p>I received my education in Warsaw, Poland, where, I attended and graduated primary school and technical college. After one semester of university, I dropped out, and did my national service in Polish Army. Now, 23 years later, making amends of my youth, studying computer science. Prior to joining university I was a full time truck driver, and had very little experience with web development. It started as a hobby, and in 2018, I began to think of possible career change. Due to lack of time, I knew, I won't be able to learn enough, so I have put everything on one horse, and here I am, making my own website for web development project.</p>
