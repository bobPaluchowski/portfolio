        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>I started designing my website on the paper, drawing ideas, and coming up with colour scheme, background image, and fonts. It was going to be a simple design, demonstrating what I have learned so far in this term, HTML mark-up was basic structured, and included main semantic tags like, header, main, aside, and footer. I decided to start by making my site mobile first, and then using media queries to make it responsive. The whole website is based on css grid, which is very responsive design. For my navigation I used input toggle to hide and show navigation bar, as this option is easier to implement, and looked very good. Main section contains main content of the page, and depending on the page, it holds grid of images, columns of text or contact form. My main source of help, except from what I have learned in web development classes, was developer.mozilla.com and w3schools.com. As the code grew bigger, it was difficult to keep track of all the changes I was making, but I could always revert to previous version, as all my work is basked up on GitHub. Every page has the same basic design, the only differences are contents of main sections, according to specifications given for this project. I have attached images of code validation, for which I used w3.org tools. The most important task for me was the design, to decide on what I want my website to look like and stick to it. My goal was to build the website that is functional and then make it look good, and I hope I have achieved my goal..</p>
