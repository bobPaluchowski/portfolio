          <p>I started by designing my website on paper, drawing ideas, background image, fonts and coming up with a colour scheme. I then moved to Adobe XP to see how my design would look on the page. I wanted to keep the design simple, but also demonstrate what I had learnt so far during this term of Web development. 
            HTML mark-up was basic structured, and included semantic tags like, header, main, aside and footer. 
            I started by making my site, mobile first, and then using media queries to make it responsive. The whole website is based on CSS grid, which is a very responsive design. 
            For my navigation I used input toggle to hide and show navigation bar, as this option is easier to implement, and it looks good. 
            The main section contains the main content of the page. Depending on the page, it holds grids of images, columns of text or contact form. When I finished the basic layout and design of all my pages, I created, test.html and test.css for testing purposes. Every time I made a change, I implemented it on my test page first to see what it looked like and when I was satisfied I committed the changes to GitHub and made changes to my project pages.
            My main source of help, except from what I learnt in web development class, was developer.mozilla.com and w3schools.com. 
            As the code grew bigger, it was difficult to keep track of all the changes I was making, but I could always revert to previous version, as all my work is backed up on GitHub. 
            Every page has the same basic design, the only differences are the contents of the main sections, according to specifications given for this project. I have attached images of code validation, for which I used w3.org tools. The most difficult task for me was the design, to decide on what I wanted my website to look like and stick to it. My goal was to build a website that is functional and then make it appealing. I hope I have achieved my goal.
